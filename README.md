# Dotfiles


Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize and personalize
your system.  The *dotfiles* name comes from the UNIX convention of prefixing
config files with a dot. By default, these files are usually hidden in directory
listings.
This repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything and
everything.
